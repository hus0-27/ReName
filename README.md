This is a Rookie Project that i am working on.

The point is to automate the process of matching the episode and subtitles folder name to make it open automatically in each episode, this will come in handy when dealing with a series of over 50 episodes, even if you are dealing with a 10 episodes sersies this may save you some brain cells.
